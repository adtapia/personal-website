            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I’m a developer passionate about creating accessible, user-friendly, and high-performance applications that seamlessly blend thoughtful design with robust engineering. My favorite work lies at the intersection of technology and creativity, where I can build solutions that are not only functional but also provide excellent user experiences.
                <br>
                Currently, I’m a computer science undergraduate at Queens College, combining my technical expertise with a strong foundation in health sciences and chemistry. I aim to use my skills to analyze chemical research data, contribute to drug development, and create impactful software solutions for the pharmaceutical industry.
                <br>
                In the past, I’ve had the opportunity to assist students as a lab assistant, guiding them through experiments and problem-solving in chemistry labs. Additionally, as the treasurer of the Alchemist Club, I have helped to create engaging, educational, and inclusive environments for my peers.
                <br>
                In my spare time, I enjoy reading, trying new cuisines, traveling to learn about different cultures, or watching a good sci-fi film. My journey is motivated by curiosity, creativity, and a strong desire to make significant contributions at the intersection of science and technology.
