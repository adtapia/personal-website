# **Adrian Tapia - Personal Portfolio**

Welcome to my personal portfolio project! This is my website where I share my projects, experiences, hobbies, and contact information. It is a platform where I can share my experiences as a software engineering student, as well as my passion for learning and creating.

## **About the Project**
I started this project in my Web Development class to learn the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This was my first time working with these technologies, and while it was challenging at first, it quickly turned into an exciting learning opportunity. The project inspired me to step outside of the classroom and experiment with new features, styling techniques, and interactivity in order to produce a polished final product.

This process allowed me to not only hone the skills I learned in class, but also experiment with new concepts like responsive design and smooth scrolling to ensure that my portfolio provides an engaging user experience.

## **Features**
- **About Me Section**: An introduction to who I am, my academic background, and interests.
- **Projects Showcase**: A dedicated section highlighting my favorite projects, with descriptions and links to GitHub repositories or live demos.
- **Contact Form**: A functional contact form to get in touch with me directly.
- **Hobbies Section**: A glimpse into my personal interests, like reading, traveling, and exploring food.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Navigation between sections is seamless and user-friendly.

## **Technologies Used**
- **HTML5**: For structuring content on the webpage.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout design.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity, such as smooth scrolling and navigation.

## **What I Learned**
This project was a significant learning experience for me. Some of the key takeaways include:
- Understanding the structure and semantics of HTML.
- Using CSS to create visually appealing designs and responsive layouts.
- Adding interactivity with JavaScript to enhance the user experience.
- The importance of iteration and refining projects to achieve a polished result.

Beyond the technical skills, I discovered the satisfaction of taking charge of a project, venturing beyond my comfort zone, and realizing my ideas.

## **Future Plans**
This portfolio is just the beginning! I plan to:
- Add more projects as I complete them.
- Continuously improve the design and functionality based on feedback and inspiration.
